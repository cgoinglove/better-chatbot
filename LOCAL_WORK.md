## Repository Overview
- **Current Branch**: `dev-spike-messy` (most stable development branch)
- **Fork Origin**: Originally forked from `cgoinglove/mcp-client-chatbot`
- **Upstream Status**: Needs update to `cgoinglove/better-chatbot` (repository was renamed)

## Branch Analysis

### Active Development Branches
- **`dev-spike-messy`** ‚≠ê **Main development branch** - Most stable, contains comprehensive changes
- **`merge-dev-spike-into-latest`** - Existing merge branch that could be reused/updated

### Experimental Branches (Bolt/WebContainer Work)
These branches represent failed/incomplete experiments with Bolt and WebContainers:

- **`bolt-port`** - Basic bolt porting attempt
- **`bolt-r2`** - Second iteration with client package fixes  
- **`bolt-port-r2`** - Third iteration, marked as "broken"
- **`bolt-port-spike`** - Had some success ("Sort of working")
- **`unocss-bolt`** - UnoCSS integration attempt, never worked properly

**Status**: All bolt branches appear to be failed experiments. The `bolt-port-spike` had the most progress but still incomplete.

### Feature Development Branches
- **`upload`**, **`upload-r2`** through **`upload-r5`** - File upload feature iterations
- **`artifacts`**, **`moar-artifacts`**, **`moar-artifacts-spike`** - Artifact system development
- **`web-search`** - Web search functionality
- **`voting`** - Voting/rating system
- **`sharing`** - Content sharing features

### UI/Component Branches
- **`shad-all-power-fix`** - ShadCN component fixes (already integrated via `193d8ce npx shadcn add -a -y -o`)
- **`fix-components`** - Component fixes
- **`last-good-deploy`** - Stable deployment state
- **`remove-shortcuts`** - Keyboard shortcut modifications

### Inspiration/Research Branches
- **`librchat-inspo`**, **`more-inspiration`**, **`vercel-ai-chatbot-features`** - Research from other chatbot projects

## Major Local Changes vs Upstream

### Package Changes
- **Version**: Downgraded from `1.7.0` to `0.1.0`
- **Dependencies**: Added many new packages including:
  - CodeMirror packages for code editing
  - Additional Radix UI components
  - ProseMirror for rich text editing
  - React Data Grid, Papaparse for data handling
  - Vercel Blob storage
- **Removed**: `next-intl`, `deepmerge`, `husky`, `lint-staged`

### File System Changes
Based on git diff, **175+ files changed** including:
- Extensive UI component additions/modifications
- New artifact system implementation  
- Authentication system changes
- Database schema changes (new migrations)
- MCP (Model Context Protocol) testing pages
- Project management features
- Document preview/editing capabilities

### Key Features Added
1. **Artifact System** - Code/document generation and editing
2. **Project Management** - Project creation and organization
3. **Enhanced UI Components** - Comprehensive ShadCN component integration
4. **Code Editing** - CodeMirror integration for code editing
5. **File Upload/Management** - Multiple file handling capabilities
6. **MCP Integration** - Model Context Protocol testing and integration

## Recommendations

### Branch Cleanup
- **Keep**: `dev-spike-messy` (main development), `merge-dev-spike-into-latest` (for merging)
- **Archive/Delete**: All bolt-related branches (failed experiments)
- **Consider Merging**: Feature branches like `artifacts`, `upload-r5` if they contain useful work not in `dev-spike-messy`

### Upstream Integration Strategy
1. Update remote from `mcp-client-chatbot` to `better-chatbot`
2. Use existing `merge-dev-spike-into-latest` branch or create new merge branch
3. Carefully merge upstream changes, paying attention to:
   - New i18n (internationalization) features
   - Updated authentication system
   - New AI model integrations
   - Enhanced UI components
   - Voice chat capabilities

### Potential Conflicts
- **Package.json**: Significant dependency differences
- **UI Components**: Extensive local modifications vs upstream changes
- **Authentication**: Both versions have auth system changes
- **Database Schema**: Local migrations may conflict with upstream

### Value Assessment
The local work contains substantial value:
- **Artifact system**: Sophisticated code/document generation
- **Enhanced UI**: Comprehensive component library integration
- **Project management**: Useful organizational features
- **MCP integration**: Advanced protocol testing

**Recommendation**: Proceed with merge but carefully review each conflict to preserve local innovations while adopting beneficial upstream improvements.
