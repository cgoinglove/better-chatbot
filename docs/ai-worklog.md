# AI Worklog and Retros - Phase 0 Implementation

Work log for tracking progress on Phase 0 tasks from VercelAiChatbotFeatures.md. New entries will be appended below.

## Instructions

Each time, summarize what was done and append here for posterity.

Be concise not flowery. This is our retro. This is how we learn and improve.

Consider the session, how things began, what went wrong until it was right, and add prompting to instruct future AI tools how to skip the pain.

Pay SPECIAL attention to any explicit corrections the user had to make in your session and prioritize based on how many times they corrected you. Include that quantitative info and ordering and be sure to effectively capture the users corrections nearly verbatim, if fragments, in order to preserve the spirit and intensity of the corrections.

# Session 1

## Task: Restore Projects UI in Sidebar

### What Happened

1. **Competing Components Identified**:

   - Found two `app-sidebar.tsx` implementations:
     - Original: `components/layouts/app-sidebar.tsx` (existing implementation)
     - New: `components/app-sidebar.tsx` (brought in from Vercel reference)
   - The Vercel version had some UI improvements but was missing our project-specific features

2. **Decision Making**:

   - Kept the original in `layouts/` because:
     - It had better TypeScript support
     - Already integrated with our authentication system
     - Contained our project management features
   - Discarded the Vercel version because:
     - It was a generic implementation
     - Lacked our project-specific features
     - Would require significant work to match our existing functionality

3. **Resolution**:
   - Removed the duplicate `components/app-sidebar.tsx`
   - Updated imports to point to `components/layouts/app-sidebar.tsx`
   - Cleaned up unused session variable in the layout component

### Lessons Learned

- ALWAYS check for duplicate/competing components first
- When porting features, look for existing implementations before adding new ones
- Pay attention to project structure and component organization

### For Future AI

- When porting features, focus on preserving project-specific functionality
- Look at git history if components appear to be missing or not working

# Session 2

## Task: Restore Command Menu and Temporary Chat

### What Happened

1. **Missing UI Components Identified**:

   - Discovered that the chat layout was completely rewritten from a client component to a server component
   - Multiple UI components were removed in the process:
     - `KeyboardShortcutsPopup`
     - `ChatPreferencesPopup`
     - Event listeners for keyboard shortcuts
     - `TemporaryChat` integration

2. **Investigation Process**:

   - Initially searched for component references in current branch (unproductive)
   - User directed to check git diff against main branch, which revealed:
     - Original client-side layout with all required components
     - Event listeners for keyboard shortcuts
     - Dialog components for shortcuts and preferences

3. **Resolution**:
   - Restored the client-side layout from main branch
   - Confirmed that Cmd+K now opens the temporary chat
   - Verified that keyboard shortcuts and preference dialogs are working
   - Updated feature documentation to mark these items as completed

### Lessons Learned

- When features disappear during port/migration, check git history first
- Look at main branch for working reference implementation
- Focus on big structural changes (client â†’ server component conversion)

### For Future AI

- To debug missing UI elements: "Check git diff against main. Look at things that were removed."
- Don't get lost in component details - look for structural changes first

- Start by searching for existing implementations before adding new code
- Check both component locations (components/ and components/layouts/)
- Look for TODO comments or disabled code that might be relevant
- Ask clarifying questions about project structure early
