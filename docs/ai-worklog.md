# AI Worklog and Retros - Phase 0 Implementation

Work log for tracking progress on Phase 0 tasks from VercelAiChatbotFeatures.md. New entries will be appended below.

## Instructions

Each time, summarize what was done and append here for posterity.

Be concise not flowery. This is our retro. This is how we learn and improve.

Consider the session, how things began, what went wrong until it was right, and add prompting to instruct future AI tools how to skip the pain.

# Session 1

## Task: Restore Projects UI in Sidebar

### What Happened

1. **Competing Components Identified**:

   - Found two `app-sidebar.tsx` implementations:
     - Original: `components/layouts/app-sidebar.tsx` (existing implementation)
     - New: `components/app-sidebar.tsx` (brought in from Vercel reference)
   - The Vercel version had some UI improvements but was missing our project-specific features

2. **Decision Making**:

   - Kept the original in `layouts/` because:
     - It had better TypeScript support
     - Already integrated with our authentication system
     - Contained our project management features
   - Discarded the Vercel version because:
     - It was a generic implementation
     - Lacked our project-specific features
     - Would require significant work to match our existing functionality

3. **Resolution**:
   - Removed the duplicate `components/app-sidebar.tsx`
   - Updated imports to point to `components/layouts/app-sidebar.tsx`
   - Cleaned up unused session variable in the layout component

### Lessons Learned

- ALWAYS check for duplicate/competing components first
- When porting features, look for existing implementations before adding new ones
- Pay attention to project structure and component organization

### For Future AI

- Start by searching for existing implementations before adding new code
- Check both component locations (components/ and components/layouts/)
- Look for TODO comments or disabled code that might be relevant
- Ask clarifying questions about project structure early
