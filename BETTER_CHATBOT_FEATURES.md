**Description**: Tavily API integration for web search with image support added in v1.14.0.

**Value**:
- Core to research capabilities vision
- User has Exa account and wants search badly
- Enhanced with image search in v1.14.0

**Implementation Status**: ❌ Not implemented (only basic reference found)
**Priority**: 🔥 Critical - Secondary port target

### 🟡 Medium Priority Missing Features

#### 3. JavaScript Execution Tool (v1.15.0)
**Description**: JS code execution capabilities to complement Python artifacts.

**Value**:
- Expands artifact system capabilities
- Complements existing Python execution
- Enables more diverse code generation

**Implementation Status**: ❌ Not implemented
**Priority**: 🟡 Medium

#### 4. Enhanced Python Execution (v1.17.0)
**Description**: Better-chatbot's Python execution approach vs current Pyodide implementation.

**Value**:
- Potentially more robust than current Pyodide approach
- Better integration patterns

**Implementation Status**: ⚠️ Different implementation exists
**Priority**: 🟡 Medium - Compare approaches

## Dependency Impact Analysis

### 1. Sequential Thinking Tool - Dependency Assessment

**Investigation Results:**
- ❌ **TOOL IS DISABLED** - Implementation exists but is commented out
- File: `src/components/tool-invocation/sequential-thinking.tsx` (commented out)
- Tool name exported but no active implementation found
- **Status**: Tool appears to be work-in-progress or disabled

**Dependencies Found:**
- Uses existing AI SDK v5 (`ai` package)
- References `ThoughtData` type from thinking tool
- Framer Motion for animations
- No external API dependencies

**Integration Complexity:**
- 🔴 **HIGH RISK** - Tool is incomplete/disabled upstream
- 🔴 **BLOCKED** - Would need AI SDK v5 upgrade first
- 🟡 **Medium** - UI components exist but disabled

**Breaking Changes Risk:**
- 🔴 **High** - Requires AI SDK v4→v5 upgrade
- May require database schema changes
- Tool is not production-ready upstream

### 2. Web Search Integration - Dependency Assessment

**Investigation Results:**
- ✅ **ACTIVE IMPLEMENTATION** - Fully working web search tool
- Uses **Exa API** (not Tavily as expected)
- Rich UI components with image support
- Complete TypeScript interfaces and schemas

**Dependencies Found:**
- `ai` package (SDK v5) for tool creation
- `ts-safe` for error handling
- `lib/json-schema-to-zod` for schema conversion
- `next-intl` for internationalization
- Exa API key requirement

**Integration Complexity:**
- 🟡 **MEDIUM RISK** - Clean, well-structured implementation
- 🔴 **BLOCKER** - Requires AI SDK v5 upgrade
- 🟢 **Low Risk** - Self-contained with clear interfaces
- 🟡 **Medium Risk** - i18n system not in your project

**Breaking Changes Risk:**
- 🔴 **High** - AI SDK v4→v5 required
- 🟡 **Medium** - i18n integration needed or strings hardcoded
- 🟢 **Low** - Additive feature otherwise
- New environment variables needed (EXA_API_KEY)

## CRITICAL DISCOVERY: AI SDK v5 DEPENDENCY

**Both features require AI SDK v5 upgrade** - This is a **MAJOR BLOCKER**

### Revised Priority Assessment

#### 1. Sequential Thinking Tool - **NOT RECOMMENDED**
- 🔴 **BLOCKED** - Tool is disabled/incomplete upstream
- 🔴 **HIGH EFFORT** - Would require AI SDK v5 + rebuilding tool
- 📉 **EFFORT**: 1-2 weeks (SDK upgrade + tool development)

#### 2. Web Search Integration - **CONDITIONAL RECOMMENDATION**
- ✅ **WORKING UPSTREAM** - Clean, complete implementation  
- 🔴 **BLOCKED** - Requires AI SDK v5 upgrade first
- 📊 **EFFORT**: 1 week (SDK upgrade) + 2-3 days (tool port)

## Revised Implementation Strategy

### Option A: Major SDK Upgrade Project
**Effort**: 2-3 weeks total
1. **Week 1-2**: AI SDK v4→v5 upgrade (breaking changes throughout)
2. **Week 3**: Port web search tool
3. **Future**: Sequential thinking when upstream completes it

### Option B: Alternative Approaches (RECOMMENDED)
1. **Build web search with current AI SDK v4** - Custom implementation
2. **Wait for AI SDK v5 upgrade** as separate major project
3. **Focus on features that don't require SDK upgrade**

### Option C: Minimal SDK Upgrade
**Effort**: 3-4 days
1. **Selective upgrade** - Only upgrade tool creation parts
2. **Maintain compatibility** - Keep existing chat system on v4
3. **Hybrid approach** - New tools on v5, existing features on v4

## Next Steps

1. **Deep dive into sequential thinking implementation**
2. **Assess exact dependency requirements**
3. **Create isolated proof of concept**
4. **Determine integration path with minimal disruption**
