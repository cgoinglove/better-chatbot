Our goal is to create the best possible chatbot UX — focusing on the joy and intuitiveness users feel when calling and interacting with AI tools.

See the experience in action in the [preview](#preview) below!

> Built with [Vercel AI SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), this app adopts modern patterns for building AI chat interfaces. It leverages the power of the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) to seamlessly integrate external tools into your chat experience.

## Preview

Get a feel for the UX — here’s a quick look at what’s possible.

### 🧩 Browser Automation with Playwright MCP

![playwright-demo](./docs/images/preview-1.gif)

**Example:** Control a web browser using Microsoft's [playwright-mcp](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp) tool.

- The LLM autonomously decides how to use tools from the MCP server, calling them multiple times to complete a multi-step task and return a final message.

Sample prompt:

```prompt
Please go to GitHub and visit the cgoinglove/mcp-client-chatbot project.
Then, click on the README.md file.
After that, close the browser.
Finally, tell me how to install the package.
```

### 🎙️ Realtime Voice Assistant + MCP Tools

[![Watch the demo](https://img.youtube.com/vi/e_8jAN9LNfc/hqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_8jAN9LNfc)


This demo showcases a **realtime voice-based chatbot assistant** built with OpenAI’s new Realtime API — now extended with full **MCP tool integration**.
Talk to the assistant naturally, and watch it execute tools in real time.


---

### ⚡️ Quick Tool Mentions (`@`) & Presets

![mention](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1a80dd48-1d95-4938-b0d8-431c02ec2a53)


Quickly call any registered MCP tool during chat by typing `@toolname`.
No need to memorize — just type `@` and select from the list!

You can also create **tool presets** by selecting only the MCP servers or tools you want.
Switch between presets instantly with a click — perfect for organizing tools by task or workflow.

---

### 🧭 Tool Choice Mode

![mention](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1a80dd48-1d95-4938-b0d8-431c02ec2a53)

Control how tools are used in each chat with **Tool Choice Mode** — switch anytime with `⌘P`.

* **Auto:** The model automatically calls tools when needed.
* **Manual:** The model will ask for your permission before calling a tool.
* **None:** Tool usage is disabled completely.

This lets you flexibly choose between autonomous, guided, or tool-free interaction depending on the situation.

---

### 🔌 Easy MCP Server Integration & 🛠️ Tool Testing

![mcp-server-install](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c71fd58d-b16e-4517-85b3-160685a88e38)

Add new MCP servers effortlessly through the UI — no need to restart the app.
Each tool is available instantly and can be tested independently outside of chat.
Perfect for quick debugging and reliable development workflows.

---


The app also offers:

* Support for multiple languages
* **A wide range of themes** — not just light and dark, but many customizable styles to choose from
* **Temporary chats** — open a quick popup chat without disrupting your main conversation.
  These are not saved and can be toggled instantly with a shortcut, making them perfect for quick side questions or testing on the fly.

…and there’s even more waiting for you.
Try it out and see what else it can do!



> This project uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) as the recommended package manager.

```bash
# If you don't have pnpm:
npm install -g pnpm
```

### Quick Start (Local Version) 🚀

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
pnpm i

# 2. Create the environment variable file and fill in your .env values
pnpm initial:env # This runs automatically in postinstall, so you can usually skip it.

# 3. (Optional) If you already have PostgreSQL running and .env is configured, skip this step
pnpm docker:pg

# 4. Run database migrations
pnpm db:migrate

# 5. Start the development server
pnpm dev

# 6. (Optional) Build & start for local production-like testing
pnpm build:local && pnpm start
# Use build:local for local start to ensure correct cookie settings
```


### Quick Start (Docker Compose Version) 🐳

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
pnpm i

# 2. Create environment variable files and fill in the required values
pnpm initial:env # This runs automatically in postinstall, so you can usually skip it.

# 3. Build and start all services (including PostgreSQL) with Docker Compose
pnpm docker-compose:up

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to get started.

---

### Environment Variables

The `pnpm i` command generates a `.env` file. Add your API keys there.

```dotenv
# === LLM Provider API Keys ===
# You only need to enter the keys for the providers you plan to use
GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY=****
OPENAI_API_KEY=****
XAI_API_KEY=****
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=****
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=****
OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434/api

# Secret for Better Auth (generate with: npx @better-auth/cli@latest secret)
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=****

# URL for Better Auth (the URL you access the app from)
BETTER_AUTH_URL=
# === Database ===
# If you don't have PostgreSQL running locally, start it with: pnpm docker:pg
POSTGRES_URL=postgres://your_username:your_password@localhost:5432/your_database_name

# Whether to use file-based MCP config (default: false)
FILE_BASED_MCP_CONFIG=false

# === OAuth Settings (Optional) ===
# Fill in these values only if you want to enable Google/GitHub login
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=
```
---

### MCP Server Setup

You can connect MCP tools via:

1. **UI Setup:** Go to http://localhost:3000/mcp and configure through the interface.
2. **Custom Logic:** Edit `./custom-mcp-server/index.ts` to implement your own logic, this also doesn't run on vercel or docker.
3. **File based for local dev:** make .mcp-config.json and put your servers in there. Only works in local dev, no docker or vercel env variable required. For example 
```jsonc
// .mcp-config.json
{
  "playwright":  {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@playwright/mcp@latest"]
    },
}
```
